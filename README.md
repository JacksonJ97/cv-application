# CV Application

A resume builder application where users can fill out a form which will but used to display a formatted resume in the preview component. Users can add/delete any number of experience and education fields. In each experience field, users can choose to add or delete as many detail points as they want. A load example button allows users to see a preview of the resume format. Users can also reset the form inputs.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Styled Components
- Lodash

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to break down a project idea into components and translate that into the file structure. I practiced React concepts such as lifting state up and passing props down components. I built this project in class components first which was later then refactored into functional components and hooks. I also practiced how to handle controlled components to sync the user's inputs to the UI.
